<Chapter 1>
Doug was a mediocre nice guy. Nobody disliked him, nobody invited him out. Not that he didn’t go out by himself, socialize, and have a good time, but at 34 he was living a simple, stable, quiet life working a back office job at a small investment firm in Philadelphia. The type of job where people lose track and regret asking him what he does for a living before he finishes the first sentence in the paragraph it takes to describe it. Nothing great, but the money ain't nothing to hate. Which was needed to pay back the loans he took out to get the degree to qualify for the job. 
He was just finishing up his Wednesday morning at work and his stomach was grumbling. He’d woken up late and hadn’t had time to grab breakfast. He realized he was in such a rush, he forgot to feed his dog. Feeling bad, he decided he’d take the 15 minute train ride home during his lunch break, feed him, and come back to the office. As he walked the floor, he passed his boss chatting with another co-worker. As far as bosses go, Gary wasn’t bad, which is a rare trait in bosses. “Doug! Glad I ran into you so I don’t have to email you. I had another meeting with Jason about the MoneyServe implementation, and got word there is a user authority export function. Unfortunately it’s only in PDF, and the whole trading floor will be using it so there’s quite a few users. He said he’d get that sent to you soon.” He was somehow always in a Jolly mood, even when giving bad news.
Doug masked his irritation with corporate sarcasm. “The fact that these companies can’t provide these lists in a machine-readable format is bonkers to me. That’ll be my whole afternoon! Anyone involved deserves cosmic retribution!” Gary chuckled, “I know I know, well, enjoy your lunch!”
“You too,” Doug replied and set off to the elevator. “Great” he thought, “An afternoon copying data from a PDF to a CSV to upload to the archive. Thank God I went to grad school.” Doug's stomach roared at him again as he left the elevator. He popped into the Bodega next door to the office to find it packed. “Yo Oscar!” Doug called to the man in the back. The man looked up, smiled, and gestured to the line, making his eyes big and smiled larger. Oscar was Puerto Rican and spoke very little English, and was a friend to all his regulars like Doug. “I need a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with everything, I’ll be back in 40”. 
“OK Papi I got you!” Oscar said. He called everyone Papi. Doug grabbed a bag of chips for the train, paid the cashier, (Oscar’s wife) and headed out the door and down to the subway. He took a peak down the track and saw the train was on its way from the last station. He popped in some earbuds, turned on some music, and tore into his bag of chips. 
There was a commotion behind Doug that he couldn’t hear due to the music and the ever so satisfying crunch of a mouthful of kettle cooked chips. A man had grabbed a woman's purse and started running. A large man tried to intervene, but only ended up knocking the thief into Doug, who instinctively grabbed onto him, sending both directly into the path of the train.
<SECTION BREAK>
All to black. Pure silence and stillness for an eternal moment. Then the turbulence hit. Flailing guests of wind and rain whipped from every direction as Doug fell through darkness until he hit the frigid water with a splash, knocking the wind out of him.
As he surfaced himself and gasped for breath, he could see he was near the shore of a rocky island, whose only structure was a large obelisk shaped office building. Doug swam to shore and tried to collect himself as the wind and rain thrashed him. As he looked around he realized he was not alone. Bodies were dropping from the sky into the water at a steady rate, and people were slowly shuffling themselves towards the obelisk. He walked towards a man and tried to call out but found himself muted by the sheer force of the gale. 
As Doug approached the obelisk, he beheld the sign over the door with ‘HELL INC.’ spelled out in brightly glowing red block lettering. He entered to a massive room, like an unholy union of the TSA and the DMV. There was a snaking queue thousands of people long, all soaking wet and miserable. At the end of the line there was a long row of windows with ‘ORIENTATION” above them. Only two windows were staffed. Doug instinctively starts heading towards the back of the line, his mind racing.
“How the fuck is this happening to me!? Why am I in Hell?? Is it because I stopped going to church!? I still believe in God though!! I never hurt a person in my life, gave to charity... and volunteered at least once a year!?”
“Nice job getting us killed you clumsy fuck!” A voice came from behind. Doug turned and saw the man he fell into the train with pushing past people who had queued behind him. The man brought his fist back to throw a haymaker at Doug but stopped dead by the mere sight of the demon. 
They almost look human, especially when wearing a suit. Though the sunken yellow eyes, pointed ears, and forehead horns are hard to miss. This particular demon was fatter, dumber, and meaner looking than the rest. “Back to your proper place in line soul, the protocol for the operation of this line is clearly established” As he gestured to a billboard of rules Doug had been too distracted to notice. Sure enough, among the dozens of procedures listed out was “your place in line is determined when you enter the line and must not change”
The initial shock had left the man. “EH NOBODY TELLS ME HOW TO DO SHIT! FUCK YOU BITCH” he yelled, and started to change the demon. The demon punched through the man's chest, ripping out the man’s beating heart. As the man collapsed, the demon set the heart ablaze to cook it for a bit, bit it like it was an apple, and tossed it back on the man’s body. The demon then took out what looked like a black coin from his breast pocket and began to speak into it. “Employee G607 requesting waste disposal at the main entrance due to a Code B4768”. A calm voice replied “Request received, waste disposal en route”
“So… is he like…gone forever now?” Doug asked nervously. “Nah he’ll come stumbling back through that door any minute now, bet he’ll mind his manners now” said the demon, smirking at his handywork. The demon looked up at Doug and his smile vanished. “What’s that above your head?” He demanded. 
”There’s something around my head?” Doug replied, while trying to look up and feel around for it but found nothing. He couldn't see it , but there was a thin halo of yellow lighting sparkling above his head. “Quit playing around and take that off!” demanded the demon. “I can’t feel anything up there, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Doug stammered. The demon marched towards Doug and threatened “You’d do well to learn to not disobey!” and reached towards Doug's head. Doug closed his eyes and cowered. At a few inches away, the halo shocked the demon’s hand, which enraged him. The demon swung his hand quickly to grab it, and it sliced the top half of his hand cleanly. Doug's face was splashed with a spurt of thick demonic blood. The demon howled in pain, then yelled into his communicator “EMPLOYEE G607 REQUESTING…EVERYONE TO HELP AT MAIN ENTRANCE FOR A CODE A1”
Dug stood there, dumbstruck, and tried to wipe the viscous blood from his eyes. 
“Employee G607 did you just say Code A1?” Asked the voice from the coin.
“YES AN ANGEL IS HERE AND HAS ATTACKED ME WE ARE UNDER AN INVASION FROM HEAVEN!”
“Angel Response Task Force already en route to main lobby, please note Code A1 requires the presence of 2 or more hostile angels to trigger full lockdown”
The demon was in a flubbering panic, and picked the severed piece of his hand off the ground and backed away from Doug. An elevator in the corner marked “STAFF ONLY” dings. Two demons exit, both tall and slender, carrying briefcases. They approach Doug and greet him. “Pardon our rude welcome sir, we had not received the usual correspondence prior to your arrival that you would be early. Please follow me to your office.”
“My…office?” Doug choked out.
The second tall demon replied, “Yes sir, we have a private office set up for you on the 4th floor. We found the souls on that floor don’t cry out in agony too loudly, they are there for the sin of Greed and mostly work our finances. Their punishment produces more groans, hysterical sobbing at worst. If you prefer different accommodations after your tour, you can submit form R5503, please follow Mr Asgroth”
“WHAT ABOUT MY HAND!? HE ATTACKED ME!” Yelled the injured demon.
“Oh shut it Garus, our scanners clocked him the second he walked inside, we saw the whole thing. Mind blowing how fast you can fuck up a situation! Which is always why you're always assigned shit duties! We finally give you a little responsibility of keeping the fresh souls in line and in one month you assault an Angel. Absolute embarrassment to the security department. Just go to floor 6 and they’ll figure something out. I’ll be covering your station and writing a D557 for Agrodoshus. Won't be surprised if it's pushed up to Minos and you're back to a mailcart where you belong."
“Eat shit Deletros!” Yelled Garus as he threw his severed fingers at Deletros who dodged them swiftly. The fingers flew towards the orientation line, hitting squarely in the back of the head of a man damned for gluttony, who stumbled over and dominoed many in line. Garus stormed off towards the staff elevator.  Deletros and Asgroth chuckled at the expense of both Garus and the bowling pin situation in the line. 
“Right this way sir, the back elevator will take us closer to your office” Asgroth said to Doug, gesturing to a bypass lane on the side of the orientation queue. Doug was still in a shell-shocked and bewildered state, but began to follow the well dressed demon towards the elevator. They entered, and with Asgroth’s command of “Greed” the elevator began to move upward.
As the door opened, they were greeted with a mind-bending visual. Short walled cubicles stretching further than the eye could see. Thousands and thousands of desk workers and mail carriers pushing giant stacks of papers through the lanes, stopping to unload binders of printed out spreadsheets for endless analysis. “Right this way” Asgroth directed towards a door near the elevator. They step inside to a dingy 10"x10" room with a desk surrounded by filing cabinets and boxes of papers on the desk. Asgroth gestured to another door in the office. “You have access to a rare amenity in this building, a private washroom with a shower. I recommend you wash up. There should be a dry suit for you. Minos will be stopping by at his nearest convenience.”
“Minos?” asked Doug. “He’s the head of judgement and security, he will reiterate to you the main do’s and don’ts, and be your main point of contact here. Belpha from HR will also probably come by with some paperwork. I suggest you start looking though your case files, become as jaded as your predecessors always became, and be ready to ask Belpha to transfer out when she swings by. Good day sir” Asgroth pivoted and walked out the door, shutting it behind him. Doug shuffled into the wash room, stripped out of his wet clothes, and stepped into a shower with no hot water. As he washed the blood from his face, his only thought was “What the HELL is going on??”
<SECTION BREAK>
<Chapter 2>
Doug turned off the frigid water and dried himself with the raggedy towel. He looked at himself in the mirror. For everything he's been through, he actually looked pretty good. The bags under his eyes were gone, and his skin looked like he just got a facial. He saw his halo above his head for the first time and tried to touch it, but only felt a light warmth as his fingers moved through it.  A freshly pressed black suit and tie with white shirt was in a bag waiting for him. No shoes though, so he hung the shoes he came in with to dry in the rest room and sauntered over to the desk to sit and think. 
"So I guess I'm...really dead. That sucks and probably can't change that. Clearly there's some kind of mix up or I'm on some divine mission from God because I'm an angel in hell who could probably fight actual fucking demons if I headbutt them or something. Is that why they're being so nice to me? So I don't just start slaughtering them all? No, that's stupid…" Doug sat for a moment and thought about the life he’d left behind. For some reason his first thought was how confused Oscar would be that afternoon that he hadn’t come back for his sandwich. Mostly Doug was sad to leave his dog hungry. He chuckled to himself. “Guess it’s a good thing I died in public so my family finds out fast and can get to him. Uggg this is going to be rough for Mom and Dad”. 
To distract himself from the thoughts, he looked around the room and on his desk and noticed he had a desk phone. Curious, he picked it up and was shocked to hear the sound of a woman's voice, devoid of all emotion. 'Central switching how may I direct your call?' For a brief moment he thought about asking room service to send him up a bottle of scotch, but didn't think he should push his luck. "Uhh, sorry, it's my first day and I don't know anyone or understand what I'm really doing here" 
"Welcome to Hell buddy” she replied with some sarcasm. “This thing says you report to Minos, patching you through now"
Doug panicked, “wasn’t this guy some kind of big shot? Am I getting on the phone with Satan's right hand guy right now?  Why am I calling him?”
"Minos here" said a gruff voice 
"Uhhhh Hello sir, this is Doug...the uhhhh, new Angel"
"Look buddy, you came in a week ahead of schedule, and I'm a busy fucking guy. I don't have time for your damn tour right this second, give me a couple hours to straighten some things out and I'll come by after. If you need something, get an intern. Don't call me for stupid shit.” *click*
Doug sat stunned. "Great, my boss is a dickhead," he muttered.
"Yuup, Minos can be that way, may I direct you to a new line?" came the first voice though the line
"Oh shit please don't tell him I said that, I didn't know you were there! Why are you listening to my calls!?"
"All calls are monitored for security and quality assurance." stated the voice dryly. "Would you like me to connect you to HR to request an intern?" 
"I suppose so?" Doug answered. After two rings a bubbly southern female voice answered.
"HR this is Belpha how may I make your day AMAZING!?"
"Hello Belpha, this is Doug, the new Angel"
"Doug!!! So excited to meet you! I am already on my way to your office, see you in a Jiffy!!!!"*click*
Doug hung up the phone to avoid the call switcher and sighed relief. At least this person seemed normal. “Maybe it was a real decent human who went to hell for a technicality?” He thought to himself. That guy said this floor is for greed, must mean the other floors are for the other deadly sins. What were those? Violence is one right?, probably want to stay off that floor. Then there's sloth...can you really be lazy enough to go to Hell?? Then there's gluttony....”
*knock knock*
Doug got up and walked over and opened the door, and was greeted by the foulest creature he'd ever seen. Belpha was vaguely human from the waist up, with a slug-like bottom half. She was slimy and bright pink, with large open sores oozing a gray green pus that gave off a smell of decay. She held two thick binders. Doug gagged and tried to cover it with a cough. 
"Gaghuhhhh please come in." Doug choked out as he made his way to his desk.
"Hello Doug, it's so nice to meet you!" Belpha replied in her sing-song voice as she slid into the office. "We are so happy to have you round here, I know most of your duties were covered in your pre-orientation in heaven, I just wanted to meet and greet and have you sign the employee handbook!" Thumping down the large binders in front of Doug. "The top one requires your signature, the bottom is yours to keep for your reference."
Doug nervously pushed back, "Uhhhh I'm no lawyer, but I don't think I should sign anything in Hell without reading it, I don't want to like, sign away my soul"
Belpha cackled "Oh curse your heart you are too funny! We got PLENTY of lawyers wandering the halls in this building but you don't need them honey! This has been the same contract your friends up there been signing since we made it 4500 years ago! Didn't they go over this with you up there?"
"That's another thing, I honestly have no clue why I'm here. I got pushed in front of a train on my way to work and now I seem to be the only angel in hell. Did God put me here?" Doug asked. When Doug said 'God' Belpha flinched but regained composure and became serious. 
"Are you tellen me you an angel that ain't never been to heaven? That don't make a lick o sense. You hit your head when you came in or somthin? Nah ya'll can't get hurt like that... Oh my this ain't right. This ain't right at all, something bad musta happened. You ain't a week early, you're just a soul that got turned round and took a wrong turn in the bardo! Oh Minos is going to have himself a fit over this. Hold on one moment."
Belpha reached up, and touched the side of her head, where there was a crude cybernetic implant grafted onto her slug body with a communication coin attached. The implant connection points looked infected. "Patch me through to Minos sweetie......Minos it's Belpha, we got ourselves a bit of a situation. This Doug feller ain't the Angel we was expecting. Done got hit by a bus this morning and washed up here an Angel."
"A Train" Doug interjected. 
"Bus, train, airplane don't matter how you kicked it! You down here now and you ain't supposed to be." Belpha shot back. "Sorry bout that Minos, what we gunna do? This ain't in the handbook... mmhmm. mmhmm. Yes darlin that's the situation. mmhmmm. alright then I'll wait here and call up the other floor managers." Belpha removed her hand from the device and looked back to Doug. "Alright honey he on his way. You sit tight right now while I make another call right quick. You know what, hand me that receiver there my implants on the frizz." Doug handed Belpha the phone receiver. "Hello darlin this is Belpha, I need you to conference me in with all the other floor managers right now. No sweetie this ain't a Code T37 we've got a full blown Y99, emergency override of any current conversation, thank you for askin......Hello y'all I do apologize for the rude interruption of y'alls conversations but we've got ourselves a bit of a situation that requires level 8 approval protocol. Yes Acedia I said level 8 there ain't no protocol established for this in the handbook, which I'm sorry means you gotta shuffle your fat ass to that elevator and on head up. I'll see y'all soon." Belpha returned the receiver to Doug. "This ain't regular at all and I don't like it.” 
Minos walked into the room without knocking. He wasn’t wearing a full suit, just the slacks and white shirt and a loosened tie. He carried a leather whip. He was disheveled and even more pissed off than usual. “Time to figure out who’s fault this is. I’ll impale them myself.” He said to Belpha. He then looked to Doug with mild disdain. “I need to hear it from you directly. If you’ve changed your mind about the position and are trying to save face that’s fine, but if you are not a sanctioned representative from Heaven that’s a real problem.”
“I promise you I have no idea what’s going on and I’ve never been to Heaven. Couldn’t we just, like, call them?” Doug said meekly. 
“Oh sure I’ll get St. Peter on the hook right away. Heck I’ll be playing golf with St. John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary this afternoon I’ll just ask them!” He sarcastically replied. “Communication with Heaven is a one way street usually, only the big boss has that power down here and he doesn’t like using it. YOU are supposed to come already trained in how to communicate back. Alright, come with us to the conference room” 
“Sure, let me just grab my shoes” Doug said as he walked over to the still dripping shoes.
“What size shoe are you?” Minos asked.
“I’m a ten” Doug replied. Minos went out to the cube Farm and called for those with a size ten shoe to raise their hands. A man nearby raised his hand. “Get over here soul, trade your shoes with this Angel.” Minos demanded. 
Doug felt a twinge of guilt seeing the man being treated like that. “Whoa, hold on I don’t need to take his shoes, these are fine, just a bit wet.”
Minos could sense Doug's pity. He raised the whip in his hand over his head, and with a crack made the whip wrap around the man, which it did 4 times. Minos closed his eyes. “This man built and ran a charity that purported to raise money for foreign orphanages. Even made it look on public forms that he took home a humble salary. The orphanages didn’t exist. They were all shell companies owned by this man. Millions of dollars swindled from people to live a lavish lifestyle. I could easily have sent him to floor two for some less-than-consensual encounters he’s had but he’s more useful here.” Doug still felt bad but reluctantly traded the wet and dry shoes with the man and put the new ones on. The man avoided looking at Doug and stared at the floor during the exchange. As the man started walking back, Minos yelled at him “Put those damn shoes on before you walk on this floor soul, closed toe shoes are mandatory at ALL TIMES. Alright you two, let's go.”
<SECTION BREAK>
<Chapter 3>
Doug followed silently behind Minos and Belpha through the endless rows of cubicles as they discussed the situation. Most of the souls kept their heads down in their work. Those who looked up did so only briefly, not daring to give Minos a reason to be angry. 
“Minos he needs to sign that handbook ASAP, if he experiences any torment directly or indirectly without a valid waiver it could be all our asses on the line. We could lose the contract outright!” Belpha said nervously. 
“I am well aware of that, but we can’t force him to sign anything.” Minos replied.
They reached another elevator, which opened as they approached. A large demon with a pig-like face who smelled like rotting meat was already on it. “What’s all this about Minos?” He asked immediately. 
“I will fill you in with all the others Gulandar.” Minos said through gritted teeth. They all crammed into the elevator, as the doors closed the smells of Belpha and Gulandar mingled together. The odor was foul enough to make Doug’s eyes water.
The doors opened to the conference room. From the pyramid shape of the ceiling, Doug would guess that he was in the tip of the Obilisk.  The table in the center was an onyx slab, which hovered without support. At the far end there was an empty black throne. The rest of the seats were simple stone cylinders. There were two already at the table, one a demon impeccably dressed, the other a slug like Belpha, but slightly less revolting. Another entity was in the room, they looked like a solid shadow giving off smoke. It moved around the table, straightening the name cards. The shadow popped up when the group entered. 
“I’ve got everything required set up Minos, anything else you need? Would you like for me to take notes?” The shadow asked eagerly. 
“We will need an additional seat for our guest. After that you may leave.” Minos replied.
“Right away sir!” said the shadow while turning to Doug “What is your name esteemed guest?” 
He answered plainly “Doug”. The shadow went to the end of the table opposite the throne and started muttering incantations.  A cylinder began to appear from thin air, and was solid within a few seconds. Doug’s name was carved intricately on the back. Another incantation created a name plate. “All set sir, does anyone else need anything? Miss Belpha?” Asked the shadow.
“Nothin now hun, please go wait in my office imma need your help after this.” Belpha said. With those instructions, the shadow collapsed in on itself, seemingly imploding into nothingness.
“Take a seat.” Minos said, gesturing to the new cylinder. As he went to the opposite end to sit to the right of the throne, the elevator dinged and more demons and slugs entered the room and took their stations. Only one space remained empty. “Thank you all for your punctuality. As we wait for Acedi, please state your name and title for the benefit of our guest.” The demons started to rise one by one to introduce themselves.
“I am Invidias, responsible for the punishment of Envy. I also run the IT department, 6th floor.” said a shabbily dressed demon. A much better dressed demon next to him rose;
“Hello sir, I am Biasupre, I punish pride and run our Marketing department, 5th floor”
A slug spoke next, “I am Ira, responsible for Wrath, 8th floor.”
The pig-faced demon Doug had ridden the elevator with raised their hand, ”I am Gulandar, I administrate the commissary and kitchen, and punish souls for gluttony. 3rd floor.” 
The demon to Doug’s right spoke next, he was well dressed but coupled it with gaudy jewelry. “I am Ritavas, head of Finance and punishing souls condemned with greed.” The elevator dinged, and the largest of all the slugs started slowly moving out of it and towards the table. 
“And now that we have Acedi, head of maintenance and punishment of Sloth, we can begin” Said Minos. “Here’s the situation. Doug here is an Angel, but has somehow ended up here with no knowledge of our own or Heaven’s protocols. If he had deserved punishment this time around he should have been routed there first for halo removal before being cast down. We need to be absolutely sure this is not our fault. Invidias, please tell me you haven’t been ‘optimizing’ the Bardo again without following proper approval and testing protocol”. Doug hadn’t considered that scenario, and began to worry again he was supposed to be here to be punished. Invidias’s eyes were wide, and started rubbing his head as he rose from the table. 
“Uhhhh let me make a quick call. Biasupre help me out here and explain this idea of yours”. He turned and started speaking quietly into a coin with his back turned. Minos looked livid. Biasupre stood and tried to remain a composed salesman. “Ok, so hear me out. We’ve been getting an influx of souls with knowledge of something called ‘AI’, and they claim it can fix all sorts of business problems. We all worked out a sort of ‘soul pre-processor’ system, which can quickly identify and pull out the worst of the worst souls. I’m talking about murderers, rapists, career criminal types. We have those limits cranked up real high while we tested it, only a small number of souls have been coming though since we turned it on Monday. I know we skipped forms PCC827, HR9322, and ICMS501, but we couldn’t test it on a simulation! I know you're mad Minos, but wait till you hear this… these systems take up an inordinate amount of processing power, so we’ve been able to increase the suffering of souls working in intake by 32%, and I stand by it 100%. No way this is our fault” He finished, boldly knocking the table with his fist. 
Invidias turned back to the group with a grim face. “I believe there is an edge-case bug in the pre-processor,” he said. Biasupre sat down and silently stared at his knees. Invidias continued; “From the logs, it looks like Doug here died in extremely close proximity to a particularly bad soul. They died right next to each other, and at the same time. In the pre-processor, instead of each soul's review paperwork being sent as a whole to one worker for review, their lives are ‘tokenized’ and sent out to a massive workforce who only has to do one small part of the problem. These tokens are then reassembled and average soul quality can be determined quickly. Part of how we organize who is working on whose review is time and location of death. Some of this bad guy's paperwork must have got shuffled in with Doug’s here, and it seems like he was tagged accidently and pulled down as well.” The room stared at the two, some with anger, some with disbelief. 
Minos was shaking with rage. “I need a minute to think how to fix this, and another to decide your fates”. He began pacing behind the throne, muttering to himself.  Ritavas took a pack of cigarettes out and lit one with the tip of his finger, shaking his head at the two. 
“Can I have one of those?” Doug asked nervously. He had quit smoking a few years ago due to peer pressure, but still missed it. Ritavas handed him the lit stick with a puzzled face and lit another for himself. Doug took a drag and coughed. He should have expected, but it was a horrible quality. Thankfully the buzz still existed down here and he relaxed a bit. 
Ritavas took his coin out, spoke “Cinder”, and put it away. The shadow from before reappeared before him. He motioned to the cigarettes. The shadow spoke an incantation, and marble ashtrays appeared in front of himself and Doug. He nodded and waved the shadow away, who once again seemed to implode into a single unseen point in space. 
“You two just dumber than a bag o bricks.” Quipped Belpha. “Absolute foolishness. Not once has anything like this happened in all the eons we been doing this. Them forms exist for a reason! Changen the Bardo without correspondence with Heaven… Absolute foolishness” There was a speaker phone in front of the throne, which suddenly started to blink. A chill ran through everyone’s spine. Even Minos’s anger was tempered by fear. He walked briskly over to the phone and pushed a button. “Yes sir?”. A cold voice came from the other line “Minos and Doug, stay. Everyone else out.” The group rose from their seats and headed towards the elevator bay. Once they were gone, the voice spoke again. “You have failed me, Minos, for the first time. I have sent word of Doug's arrival to Heaven. I expect we will have a visitor soon. See to their needs and we will discuss your fate after.” The blinking stopped. Minos grabbed his coin and spoke into it.  “Angel Response Task Force, report to the main entrance immediately. We will soon have a visitor that will need an escort up to the executive conference room.”
“Finally, someone is coming to save me.” thought Doug, as he took another rip. “Might not be smokes in Heaven so I better enjoy this last one!” It went down a little smoother this time. Minos’s comm spoke to him “Sir it seems as though VOG is already in the building on his way to you, he ignored and bypassed all security.” At that moment the elevator dinged and an Archangel stepped out. Doug turned and saw the divine being, shocked and humbled by its beauty. The tips of his wings toward a foot above his head, framing a strong but kind face. The wavy golden hair matched his gold armor, which was intricately engraved. He also carried a mighty sword unsheathed in his hand. Doug quickly smashed out the cigarette and considered kneeling, but just sat there trying to find words. “Are you here to save me!?” Doug blurted out. Before the angel could answer, Minos interjected bitterly “Voice of God or not, I’d appreciate it if you followed our protocols Michael.” 
“I will spend as little time in this wretched place as I need to, Minos.” He calmly stated, then turned to Doug. “I must be brief, as I cannot bear long the suffering within these halls. You are truly here by an unsanctioned modification of the grand cosmic path, and should have rejoined us in the holiest of holies upon your bodily demise. Even more unfortunate, I have no way of bringing you back with me currently, as your soul is in too fragile a state for the path I travel. Fortunately, a gateway is already being prepared to be opened in a week's time for an ambassador. With a week's rest, you should be able to make that journey. To best protect yourself against the evils of this place, sign the agreement they have laid out for you. I personally attest to its soundness, I was involved in the negotiation. I also have a letter for you.” Michael handed Doug an envelope, beautifully embossed with a border and his name in gold. 
“Who’s the letter from?” Doug asked.
“He whose words I carry, and loathe to utter in the presence of…” Michael said as he gestured with his sword to the empty throne. “Rest, and hold your faith.” An elevator dinged, with the two tall briefcase toting demons as before on it. Michael turned and started walking towards it. “Wait!” shouted Doug. Michael turned to him. “Can you make sure my dog is taken care of?” Michael smiled and answered “I will personally pass along your prayer to Francis, your pet will go to a good home.” He turned and continued to the elevator. “Main Lobby” said Deletros, and the doors closed. 
Doug sat in silence, and Minos took his seat, rubbing his eyes. “Are you alright?” Doug asked. 
“Go back to your office, and sign the damn paperwork.” Minos grumbled.
“I don’t know how to get there…” Doug replied.
“I can’t deal with your ignorance right now as well, I’ve got enough on my plate.” Minos snapped. He took his coin out and spoke to it. “Cinder, up here now”. The shadow appeared. “Take Doug to his office”
“Right away sir! Follow me sir!” the shadow replied, and headed for the elevator. Doug followed. Curious if he had the power to control the elevator, he said “Greed” as he stepped on. “Very good sir! You learn quick!”. The elevator began to move. Doug, feeling a bit emboldened from his last interaction, turned to the shadow and simply asked “So uhhh, what are you? Oh sorry, who are you?” 
“I’m Cinder sir, the executive team intern. To answer your first question, I’m a jinn, we exist on all planes of existence, have free will, yada yada yada, all in the handbook under Appendix N4.2 ‘Spirit Entities’. I just think this place is neat, and the team is awesome when you get to know them!” The elevator doors opened, and Doug followed Cinder through the maze of cubicles back to his office. He shuffled inside and sat at his desk. 
“Anything else I can get your sir?” Cinder asked eagerly.
Doug decided to press his luck given Cinders demeanor, “Bottle of scotch and a pack of smokes?” He said with a joking cheeky grin. 
“I will do my best!” Cinder exclaimed, and disappeared with a puff. Doug stared at the envelope in his hands for a moment before opening it. He pulled out a card, the back of which was embossed in gold with beautiful geometric designs. The inside simply read:
<GNOTE>
Doug felt a great wave of comfort as he read it, but it also confused him. Was that advice? A command? A letter salutated and signed with no body? A knock came at the door. “Come in” Doug said, and a demon entered carrying a cafeteria tray with a pint of whiskey, a pack of cigarettes and a box of matches. He set it atop a box on Doug's desk, bowed, and left. Doug put the card on his desk with the words facing him, and reached for the pack of smokes. He took one out, lit it, and pulled a heavy drag. He coughed again after exhaling, but he began to appreciate the harshness of the flavor. “I was told to relax, that’s just what I’m going to do. Happy to have a week of vacation even if it is in Hell.” he thought as he grabbed the pint. He took a swig and was happy to find the quality was not on par with the smokes, it was actually quite smooth. It hit hard too, this had to at least be cask strength.
The two employee handbooks were still on his desk. He flipped it open to find a hundred or so pages of tiny font and dense legal language. He flipped to the back where there was a place for his signature. He took another big swig. He was still worried he was being duped or tricked, but he looked at the letter on his desk and felt a courage within himself to sign the paper. After another rip of the dart, wet ink hit the page.
<SECTION BREAK>
<Chapter 4>
As he finished his signature he almost expected something drastic to happen, but there were no flashes of red light or manacles appearing on his wrists. He sat back in his chair and continued smoking. He reflexively reached in his pocket, looking for a phone as a modern person does in their first down moment. He chuckled to himself as he remembered where he was. He took another swig and just stared at the ceiling for a while, trying to unwind a bit. He was definitely buzzed, but he felt restless, not the least bit tired. Just to do something other than stare at a ceiling, he decided to start at least get the pile of boxes off his desk and stacked in a corner, and get his office in order. He did so slowly, and eventually just had a single box, the phone, and the card on the desk. Rather than putting it in the corner, he opened the box and found binders of varied thickness. He took each out and laid them out on the desk, and also found a single loose sheet of paper on the bottom. Binders with titles like ‘Good Choices’, ‘Bad Choices’, ‘Circumstances’, ‘Ethical Training’, and more, all filled with the details of the life of some guy named ‘Jack Benhoff’. His actions, motivations for those actions, everything. Thousands of pages. Doug took a look at the single sheet. The header read ‘Form ID J431: Judgement Modification Request’. Below that was a box detailing his current sentence; 280 years for sloth, 275 for envy, and 245 years for lust. At the bottom was a box to write in how the judgement should be modified, and two signature boxes. 
Doug was curious how lazy and horny you need to be to land yourself in hell, so he started flipping through the binders, starting with ‘Bad Choices’. It was filled with spreadsheets with datapoints of sinful actions. Time, place, category, severity, and references to appendix documentation. Doug started to feel a bit like a 1950’s PI, wearing his suit in a dingy smoke filled office, he was ready to crack the case. He dove deep into Jack’s life, both the good and the bad. It was a tough read.
Jack started out a regular kid. He grew up in the suburbs, played baseball, and spent his early childhood wanting to be in the pros. When he was 13, he was in a severe car accident which resulted in him losing the bottom half of his left arm. His mind was also scarred by losing any hope of living his dream. He started to hate school where was bullied, and dropped out as soon as he could. He was able to apply for and receive disability, and lived in his parents basement his whole life, mostly watching porn or baseball podcasts in a haze from the pain pills he abused. 
Doug spent some time flipping though the spreadsheets looking for the best and worst things Jack had done. “If any of that porn was child stuff I’m keeping this guy down here forever” Doug thought to himself. Thankfully that was not the case, his worst sins in lust were the few times he hired a prostitute.  Jack's good deeds were mostly related to his relationship with his parents. He and his father loved to talk baseball, and he did quite a bit to take care of both of them in their old age. 
The phone on the desk began to ring. Doug had been sipping away at the whiskey and was at this point, a little drunk. He answered “Detective Doug here” jokingly. 
“Come down to my office.” Minos said curtly. “Cinder will escort you” *click* 
“Oh cool, the first meeting I have with my demon boss I’ll be showing up drunk. This can’t go wrong.” Doug thought sarcastically. Cinder knocked and opened the door. “Right this way sir!” Doug grabbed the J431 form and followed silently to an elevator. “Basement” Cinder said, and the elevator began to descend. With a ding, the elevator doors opened to a thin hallway with three doors at the end. The two walked towards them. The door on the right read ‘Operations’, the door on the left read ‘Minos’. The door in the center looked like a bank vault, labeled with an inverted pentagram. Cinder knocked on Minos’s door and entered. “Doug for you sir! Would you like for me to take notes?”
“That will be all Cinder. Take a seat.” Doug looked about the office. It really wasn’t much different than his, just larger to accommodate even more boxes. The wood chair across from Minos had shackles built into it. Doug approached but hesitated. Minos looked up from the form he was filling out. “Those aren’t for you, don't mind them”. Doug sat nervously but kept his cool. For a long moment they just stared at each other, almost sizing each other up.  Minos was trying to find reasons to be angry at Doug but couldn’t think of any. Doug broke the ice, “Well, it looks like you didn’t get canned for this, that’s good”. 
“Fates of many will be decided upon the success of your leaving this place in one week's time. Should the transfer fail…” Minos trailed off, and Doug sensed some actual fear from Minos. “Not a contingency I’m even going to plan for” he said, shaking his head. “I need your word that you are going to take this seriously, and rest. What do you need to entertain yourself? Deck of cards? I can send a jinn to the mortal world to learn simple objects, could get a book? that could take a day or two though.” 
“I think I should be alright left to my own devices.” replied Doug. “The boxes in my office contain some real interesting data/stories. I read all about this guy Jack Benhoff before I came down here. I found this ‘J431’ form in there as well, do I have the power to commute this guy's sentence?” He asked.
Minos looked properly annoyed again, and jabbed his finger at Doug as he said “Because you signed the handbook, you technically have the power to <strong>request</strong> that I <strong>modify</strong> a sentence, and I have the right to say no. However, that job is for someone properly trained for it. You are walking into something you don’t understand.”
“Well, it does seem a bit excessive. This is like, over 800 years and he never really hurt anyone.” Doug could tell that questioning Minos’s judgement annoyed him further and he had to hold back a tirade he would have given to anyone else. Instead he just snapped “Fine, you wanna do this? Give me that form”. Doug placed the J431 on the desk and Minos took a look at it. After a few moments as Minos picked up his desk phone. “Patch me into floor 2…..Belpha I’m looking for the soul of Jack Benhoff. Soul ID HCO88190NNFJ-V. By my math he should be in Lust…..Got it. Patch me into floor 7….Invidias, I’m looking for the soul of Jack Benhoff. Soul ID HCO88190NNFJ-V. Have him escorted down to me immediately. Also, I’m assuming you're pulling souls from other departments to fix this mess, make sure you are submitting TR45’s for every single one you need longer than 24 hours, I will be reviewing them personally…..One more thing switching, get me Cinder in here." He hung up the phone and Cinder appeared in the office. Minos looked at it and said “Today’s the day Cinder, we are processing a J431, which requires minutes to be taken” Cinder squeaked with joy, and took a seat on the ceiling above them. Minos looked back to Doug, handing him the form and a pen from a drawer. “I’m going to need in writing what should be reduced and a valid reason why.” Minos said “Don’t just give me some bullshit ‘he didn’t hurt anyone’ excuse. Just because you’re here by accident doesn’t mean anybody else is.”
Doug took the paper and tried to remember the details but his head was still swimming. He felt the huge burden of this strange man's fate suddenly in his hands and wished he’d taken this more seriously, at least not be drunk for it. He was still trying to remember the good things he had done when the knock came at the door. A demon entered, along with the soul of Jack Benhoff who seemed terrified. “Come stand over here Doug, take a seat soul.” Doug stood up and moved to the right of the desk. Jack sat down, and the shackles instantly sprang to his wrists and ankles. Minos stood and unhooked his whip from his belt. He swung it in a swift motion, over his head and caused it to wrap around the man, which it did once. Minos’s eyes were closed for a moment as he judged the man’s entire life. He opened his eyes and started winding the whip back into a ring in his hands, shaking his head. “What a wasted life. A self imposed jail cell of self-pity. Many have lost more than an arm and gone to live fulfilling lives.” The man stayed silent and looked at the floor. 
“Well hold on, he did lose more than his arm, he lost his dream.” Doug tried to protest, but Minos went into a full tirade, yelling and jabbing a finger at Jack. 
“He lost all motivation for anything! All discipline, all will to better himself or his community. Tell me soul, when were you happiest in life after the accident?” Minos demanded. “Uhh.. I don’t know…” Jack stammered. “I will refresh your memory, when you were 22, you volunteered to help coach baseball at the local little league. Which you did for a few months. Those months were the only time you attempted to connect with and do any good in the world. You might have even done so had you not attempted to flirt with the married mother of one of the children and subsequently asked to not come back. After that you let yourself rot, poisoning your body, mind and soul with depravity and cheap hedonism at the monetary, emotional, and moral expense of others. I could have charged this soul for violence against self, the whip <strong>spared</strong> him to Sloth.” Doug had never felt a more awkward five seconds of silence as Minos sat back down, broken only when Jack began to sob lightly. 
“He.. he’s right.” Jack said weakly between sobs. “I deserve this. I am trying hard to learn this all before I go back, and have come a long way since I got here. I want to live a good life.” Doug was now fully embarrassed for himself and the man at this point, and also confused. “Go back?” Doug asked. He realized he never had considered what happens at the end of the sentence. 
Minos sighed and flipped back to a tone of soft annoyance “Unless Doug wants to prove to us his ignorance further, your examination is over soul, return to your work. You will receive a judgement verdict once rendered” Doug stayed silent and Minos waved his hand, causing the manicales to release. The escort demon took him by the arm and led him out the door. As Doug walked back to the seat, Minos asked “Are you ready to stop pretending you know what’s going on here and go back to just doing what I say?”
Doug replied sheepishly, “Yeah, sorry man I didn’t mean to like, challenge you like that. I’m still really confused about what’s going on here. I thought hell was forever, but are you saying it’s only temporary? Do they all get punished and then go to Heaven?” 
“Look, I’m not going to sit here for the hours it would take to explain our entire process let alone the underlying metaphysical infrastructure of the cosmos.” Minos replied, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “To answer that though, they do not go to Heaven they go back to earth, or some other celestial body capable of growing souls, wherever the Bardo takes them. We are contracted to take in souls primarily from Earth as we have the facilities best suited to get these souls back to the mortal/celestial realm with a proper fear of the consequences of evil deeds. Now, can you please go back to your office, and rest.”
Doug rose without protest and walked to the door. He stopped as he reached for the handle, and turned back to Minos. “5% reduction in remaining sentence time. He was good to his parents in his life, and showed remorse and growth in his time here.” Minos glared at him. He grabbed the J431 and the pen and started scribbling on it then spun it towards Doug.
“I will give a 1% reduction to placate this hero complex of yours and you can pat your back and say to yourself you did something. Final offer or get out.” Doug walked up, and signed the final box and extended his hand to Minos. Minos looked him in the eyes and said “Get out”.
Doug turned and left as Minos gave instructions to Cinder on where to deliver the paperwork. He closed the door, all alone in the deepest hallways of Hell. 
<SECTION BREAK>
<Chapter 5>
Doug stood in the hall for a moment, staring at the center door with the inverted pentagram. It didn’t need to be a secure vault for him to not want to go in there. The Operations door was like any other. Doug was curious to what that could possibly look like, and this would (hopefully) be the last time he’d be down here. “I’m safe from physical harm, so the worst case is Minos gets mad? Just a peak, won’t hurt anything.” Doug thought, as he reached for the door with images of a massive labyrinth of demonic machinery. He opened the door and stuck his head in the door. It was yet another cube farm, filled with mostly demons with some humans mixed in. One of the humans near him had their phone ring, picked it up and answered “Central Switching, how may I direct your call”. Doug recognized the voice as the sarcastic woman he spoke with earlier. He could only see her profile, but he thought she was pretty. At least, as pretty as one can be in hell without access to showers. Or maybe anything down here that isn’t oozing a weird pus seems acceptable?
Doug backed out of the room. Not worth sticking around to run into Minos. He walked to the elevator and told it to take him to the Greed floor. By this point he knew which direction his office was, so he started walking slowly though the aisles with an uncomfortable feeling. He still felt pity for the workers trapped in the endless paperwork, but less so. That Jack guy admitted he should be here and it was actually helping, and knowing that this was a temporary thing and not forever made it less extreme. Maybe this is why all of his predecessors got jaded and gave up?
He reached his office and went inside, to find a stack of letters on his desk in a variety of colorful envelopes. He sat at his desk and started flipping through them. Some had ‘From the desk of ____’ with a saint’s name in them, others were addressed directly to Doug. He started opening them, and found they were prayers from various people. Some of them were from strangers who had witnessed the accident. Others were from family, co-workers, and friends, some of whom he hadn’t spoken to in years. Oscar and his wife seemed to have prayed together and their letter came as one. Doug broke down crying as he read that one, but continued to read on. He never had really grasped the impact he had on people.  Part of the reason he had been non-chalant about his worldly demise up to this point was the feeling that he wouldn’t really be missed much up there. 
It took him a while to get through the stack, slowly finishing that pint and having a couple more smokes. By the end he was emotionally drained and once again drunk, wanting to just pass out and sleep through the rest of the week. He still felt restless though, even though he figured it had to be the equivalent of night time given the amount of time he’d spent down here. He realized he’d been shown to his office, but there was no mention of a room. He weighed his options, which included wrapping the binder of Jack’s good deeds in the ragged towel from the bathroom to use as a pillow. He decided he’d try and call Belpha to ask. As gross as she was, she was at least nice. Doug grabbed the phone and heard the same voice, “Central switching, how may I direct your call?” 
“Belpha, please” Doug requested. The line rang a few times. “Belpha here” She replied, still friendly but not as much as before due to the stress of the day. “Hey Belpha, this is Doug. Sorry if I’m bugging you with something that’s in the handbook, but do I have a room to sleep in?”
“Sleep?” Belpha replied with confusion. “Ain’t no sleep in hell darlin, ain’t no such thing as tired for your kind any ways why you wanna sleep?”
“Honnestly I’m just kinda drunk and sad, ready to be done.” Doug said with a defeated tone. 
“Well hun I can’t help you with that, you done robbed tomorrow for today and you gunna have to sit though that.” She said matter-of-factly. “We need you rested though, so I’mma call down to maintenance and see if we can work something out. I suggest you learn to pace yourself.” The line clicked and went silent for a moment. 
“Anywhere else I can direct the call?” the voice asked. 
“Uhhh, I guess not…” Doug replied. His loneliness was tempered a bit knowing that he was talking to a human soul, and tried to push a conversation. “How come it’s always you that answers, there’s hundreds of people in your office” 
“I’m the primary switcher for the executive team.” She said plainly. 
“Oh cool….” Doug was at a loss for anything interesting to say. “Guess you’ll be hearing from me some time later then… What’s your name?”
“In my last incarnation it was Jane, not sure I like identifying like that anymore though to be honest.” She replied.
“Gottcha, it would make sense you don’t want to be associated with the person that got you in here, sorry to bring that up. See you around…” Doug hung up the phone before he started embarrassing himself further. “Even as the only angel in Hell I fumble getting a woman to be interested in me” he chuckled to himself. 
There was a knock on his door. Doug answered it to find a demon carrying a wood and canvas cot, along with a makeshift pillow made of a sack stuffed with clothing. As the demon set the cot up, Doug noticed the canvas had what looked like a large dried blood stain on one end of it. There was no blanket. The demon bowed to Doug and left the room. 
Doug went to his washroom and grabbed the raggied towel and laid down on the cot for a while, trying to fight the hangover that started to form. He tried meditating, just trying to clear his mind and not think about his situation. The thoughts kept coming though, jumping from memories of his past life, to the uncomfortable feeling of accepting the suffering of these souls, and to the quick moment he laid eyes on Jane.
